Title: Extract code (and output) from R session transcript
Description:  This is a script and some functions that I have used to
 take an the transcript of an R session  (e.g. during class)
 and extract the top-level expressions/commands and/or the
 output from the commands.
 I used this after lectures to create an Rdb and then HTML file of the
 R session.
